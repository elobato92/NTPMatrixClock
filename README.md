# NTPMatrixClock
Make an NTP clock from some Sprite Link LED matrices and an ESP8266

This project is an application of Tumaku's Instructables tutorial on ["Multiple LED Matrices With Arduino".](http://www.instructables.com/id/Multiple-LED-Matrixes-with-Arduino/).

Simply build your circuit as he did and then flash this code to whatever embedded device is running it.

I accomplished this with a SparkFun Thing-dev board.

There are two files, NTPScrollMinutesReal.ino will display output as HH:MM as it scrolls across your matrices, the other will display HH:MM:SS.
